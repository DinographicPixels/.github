## About
### Story
Dinographic, originally DinographicPixels, has been been founded in 2017 by Wade B. (@pakkographic) with the ambition to bring a wide variety of dreams come true. From games, software to developer tools, we have worked on many projects, some of them have been discontinued, some are private (or both). Everything started with the early development of the WaitingForHero (WFH), a horror, stress-based game that has been later discontinued after 3 and a half year of development. Since then, we've been building wonderful projects such as Wazowski Memer or our latest public release [TouchGuild](https://touchguild.com), a library for making apps on Guilded, and that lays a strong foundation for developers to make incredible projects out of it.

### Vision
Dinographic operates as a boss-free company, fostering a collaborative environment where engineers can team up to create projects aligned with our core vision. Our mission is to build high-quality products that are simple, intuitive, and refined.

User experience is at the heart of everything we do. We believe in taking care of the details while maintaining simplicity, ensuring a seamless experience for the user.

Beyond design and functionality, we strive to make a positive impact on people's lives. Products tailored to specific audiences should not only meet their needs but also inspire and empower them by delivering exceptional value and usability.

### Meaning of DinographicPixels
DinographicPixels signifies "Graphism composed of pixels as gigantic as a dinosaur," emphasizing both the grandeur and scale of our creations. Additionally, the name highlights the dynamic and versatile nature of pixels, reflecting our innovative and adaptive approach to design. The name of the company is often shortened to Dinographic or DP, making it shorter to write.
